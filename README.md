## Python implementation of simplicial sets

Simplicial sets are a powerful generalization of simplicial complexes that allow quotient operations. We define data structures for simplicial sets and implement them in python. Eventually we want to do topological data analysis of point cloud data using simplicial sets as the objects representing homotopy types/ topological spaces.  

There is one file sset.py defining three class 

- scomplex (SIMPLICIAL COMPLEX)
- semi_sset (SEMI-SIMPLIAL SET/ DELTA COMPLEX)
- sset (SIMPLICIAL SET)

For definitions of these objects see

- Simplicial complex (Wikipedia page) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex)
- Simplicial set (Wikipedia page) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_set)
