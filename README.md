## Python implementation of simplicial sets

Data structures for simplicial sets are implemented in python. Simplicial sets are purely algebraic structures which are able to capture the homotopy theory of topological spaces. There are more general than the more geometric simplicial complexes. One essential difference between simplicial sets and simplicial complexes is that the former category is cocomplete (so that one can do collapsing operations on simplicial sets). 

There is one file sset.py defining three classes (implementing data structures for)

- scomplex (SIMPLICIAL COMPLEX)
- semi_sset (SEMI-SIMPLIAL SET/ DELTA COMPLEX)
- sset (SIMPLICIAL SET)

For definitions of these objects see
