Simplicial sets are a powerful generalization of simplicial complexes that allow quotient operations. We define data structures for simplicial sets and implement them in python. Eventually we want to do topological data analysis of point cloud data using simplicial sets as the objects representing homotopy types/ topological spaces.  

There is one file sset.py containing three class 

scomplex (SIMPLICIAL COMPLEX)
semi_sset (SEMI-SIMPLIAL SET/ DELTA COMPLEX)
sset (SIMPLCIAL SET)
