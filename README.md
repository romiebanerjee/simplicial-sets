Simplicial sets are a powerful generalization of simplicial complexes that allow quotient operations. We define data structures for simplicial sets and implement them in python. Eventually we want to do topological data analysis of point cloud data using simplicial sets as the objects representing homotopy types/ topological spaces.  

A simplicial complex is a geometric figure obtained by gluing simplices of various dimensions along the faces. A simplex of dimesion $n$ is the covex hull of the set of standard basis bactors $\{e_1,\ldots, e_{n+1}\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Therefore a $0$-simplex is a point, a $1$-simplex is a line segment, a $2$-simplex is a triangle, a $3$-simplex is a tetrahedron and so on. 

In a simplcial complex every simplex is uniquely expressed by the collection of its vertices. For instance a vertex set $\sigma =\{0,\ldots,m\}$ forms the $m+1$ vertices of a $m$-simplex $\sigma$. The simplex $\sigma$ has $m+1$ faces denoted by $d_i(\sigma), 0\leq i \leq m$, which are $m$-simplices, associated with them. Here $$d_i(\sigma) = \{0,\ldots,\hat{i}, \ldots,m\}$$ obtained by omitting the $i$-th vertex. 

An abstract simplicial complex is a pair $X = (V,\Sigma)$ where $V$ is a finite set and $\Sigma \subset \mathcal{P}(V)$ is a collection of subsets of $V$ with the following property: If $\sigma \in V$ and $\tau \subset \Sigma$, then $\tau \in \Sigma$.

Given such a pair $X = (V,\Sigma)$ we form a simplicial complex as follows. The sets of vertices are in bijection with the set $V$. An ordering on $V$ gives and ordering on the vertex set. If $V = \{a_0,\ldots,a_n\}$, a subset $\sigma = \{a_{k_0} \ldots a_{k_n}\}$ (preserving the ordering of $V$) denotes the corresponding $n$-simplex. For example we may model a circle using the abstract simplcial complex with $V = \{1,2,3\}$ and $\Sigma = \{\{1,2\},\{2,3\}, \{1,3\},\{1\}, \{2\},\{3\}\}$.

Given an abstract simplicial complex $(V,\Sigma)$, let $\Sigma_k \subset \Sigma$ be the subset of $k$-simplices. There are faces maps $$d_i: \Sigma_k \to \Sigma_{k-1}, \, 0 \leq i \leq k$$ $$d_i(\{a_{l_0},\ldots,a_{l_n} \}) = \{a_{l_0},\ldots,\widehat{a_{l_i}}, \ldots, a_{l_n}\}$$
